# AddmetoTelegramBot
Telegram bot for forwarding messages from addmeto channel to addmeto comments chat. Right now the implementation is very dirty due to Telegram Bot API lacking functionality for reading public channels.

## Usage
1. Add .env file to the directory with `TELEGRAM_API_KEY=xxx` (without double or single quotes anywhere) defined.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
